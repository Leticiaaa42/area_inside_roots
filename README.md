# area_inside_roots
An old project I made in python when I was first getting used to programming back in 2023. It takes in a complex number and an index, and uses De Moivre's second formula to create all complex roots of nâˆš(a+bi) and use them as vertices for a polygon in the complex plane, the area of which is the output.

Note how as the index n tends to infinity, the value aproaches pi, due to the fact all roots have the same absolute value and that tends to 1 as n increases, thus creating a circle of radius 1, which has the area of pi.
